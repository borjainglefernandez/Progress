Classes:
-Exercise
-Workout
-Split

Exercise Fields:
-type (either weight, reps, or time as a string)
-weightedType(NULL for reps and time, either dumbbells, barbell, or machine for weighted exercises)
-sets (int)
-data (either weight, reps, or time as a double or int)

Exercise Methods:
-map calculatePlates(double weight, string type)
*** @Param weight is the weight in pounds
*** @Param type is the type of the weighted exercise(either dumbbells, barbell, or machine)
*** @Return a map<int, int> corresponding to how many of each plates
*** EX: calculatePlates(315, barbell) -> {45: 6}

-num(double or int) calculateAverage(int/double[] data) 
*** @Param data is the weight, reps, or time of a set of exercises
*** @Return a num(double or int) of the average of all of the sets
*** EX: calculateAverage([10,12,14,16]) -> 12
